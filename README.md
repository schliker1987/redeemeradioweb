# ANONYPROXIES WEB PROXY - README #

Welcome to the SuperHeroFM project -- an open source project for allowing the world to safely and securely surf the internet through tunneled proxy connections of all types -- above the auspices of the Golden Ticket, Ticket to Gold and Disabled to Gold.

### Attribution requirements ###

If you are using this code base, a link back to the https://SuperHeroFM.com URL is required in addition to an email to founders@curecrm.com with your URL so that we can add you to the mirrors list.  You might get quite a bit of traffic from our mirrors selector :)

[TODO] to our developers, we need someone to build a Javascript widget as part of this project that each of the mirrors sites uses to show the dropdown of mirrors.  The API on this can be part of anonyapi located at https://bitbucket.org/anonysurfer/anonyapi/ - This is easy :) - there should probably be a basic cron job checking to see if the mirrors are still live on a regular basis and maybe even emailing them as part of an SuperHeroFM.com listserv.  Keep it up!

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo holds the A2, Glype, PHProxy, CGIProxy and other proxies.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Contact founders@anonyproxies.com to be added to the project.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Clean code!
* Bootstrap!
* Code on index.html must be responsive!

### [TODO] ###

Hi there, here's the spec under Ticket to Gold, Disabled to Gold, and Golden Ticket: 

Visit https://www.anonyproxies.com - there are a few things to make happen:

1. Create an auto-deploy section on the page that allows you to automatically deploy the service to a new cloud VPS for a service fee just like the other sections that say Subscribe Now. This needs to be part of the API which is located at https://anonyproxies.com/api/ (django-rest-framework).  The API url mentioned and its functions just needs some configuration to resolve any kind of Internal Server Error and it needs setup to ensure it runs using a database like MySQL (settings can be places in live.py of anonyapi repo located at https://bitbucket.org/anonysurfer/anonyapi/.  The section and the configuration modal that you generate allows the person to at any moment in the future specify custom advertisement javascript code or any javascript code at the top of the A2, Glype, PHProxy, PHProxy++ pages assuming the user is logged in (use a "Config" button that opens up a modal where this can be configured using our API).  The "Config" button and its modal also allows the user to specify if they want their deployment to be part of the mirrors, a DNS domain name option where they can provide a domain name (otherwise we provide them automatically with a domain subdomain of anonyproxies.com and anonyproxi.es [an alias of anonyproxies.com])

2. VPN sections need to be configured and a .sh script needs to be generated to automatically setup the VPN and proxy options that are offered on https://anonyproxies.com 

3. Login functionality needs to be setup so that people can login to the /secure/ URL with some kind of secure cookie and also login to the individual sections 

4. PhoneGap application needs to be deployed (the code is already there, just needs to be compiled) with more clear instructions for setting everything up at https://bitbucket.org/anonysurfer/anonyproxiesgap/ - an .apk file, Apple Store file, Microsoft Store file needs to be generated and uploaded to the PhoneGap repository at https://bitbucket.org/anonysurfer/anonyproxiesgap/

5. If logged in to both the anonygap and anonyweb apps from github.com/anonyproxies/ - sections on the page need to show, based on what was paid for in particular whatever VPN or proxy details are necessary to use the application.
